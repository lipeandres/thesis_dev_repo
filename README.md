thesis_dev_repo
===============

Definite repo for our thesis development. 

IMPORTANT
-> Buildroot is intended to be compiled with codebench sourcery's 2010.08 arm toolchain, you can of course try to compile it with a different toolchain but some packages will likely fail to compile, also the linux kernel header won't be the correct ones for the linux kernel used in this repo (2.6.35.3).
