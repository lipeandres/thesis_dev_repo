===============

Definite repo for our thesis development. 

IMPORTANT
->In order for buildroot compilation to work with the stamp_defconfig or
the stampfull_defconfig you should either disable any kernel compilation 
in buildroot or compress linux-2.6.35.3 as linux-2.6.35.3.tar.bz2 
and put it inside buildroots dl folder.
