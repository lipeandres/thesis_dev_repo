Submitting patches to the OpenOCD mailing list:

By the time you have read this, one supposes that 
you have figured out how to clone the OpenOCD git
repository.

Below is a basic workflow and specific instructions 
to get you going with git and patches.

0. Clone the git repository, rather than just
download the source. 

git clone git://openocd.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/openocd/openocd

or if you have problems with the "git:" protocol, use
the slower http protocol:

git clone http://repo.or.cz/r/openocd.git

1. Set up git with your name and email:

git config --global user.name "John Smith"
git config --global user.email "john@smith.org"

2. Work on your patches. Split the work into 
multiple small patches that can be reviewed and
applied seperately and safely to the OpenOCD
repository.

while(!done) {
  work - edit files using your favorite editor.
  run "git commit -a" to commit all changes. 
}

TIP! use "git add ." before commit to add new files.

--- example comment, notice the short first line w/topic ---
topic: short comment
<blank line>
longer comments over several
lines...
-----

3. Next you need to make sure that your patches
are on top of the latest stuff on the server and
that there are no conflicts.

git pull --rebase

4. Generate the patch files. This will generate
patches for all commits that are on top of
the latest stuff on the server:

git format-patch origin/master

5. Email the patches to openocd-development@lists.berlios.de
